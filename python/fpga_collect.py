fpga_collect.py — Collects BB84/UWOC data on the FPGA for the paper
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DIFFERENT from bb84_uwoc_measure.py: that script sweeps fast to LOOK; this one
runs LONG to PRODUCE PUBLISHABLE DATA, so it has three things the other lacks:

  [1] A DUAL BUDGET per measurement point — stop on ENOUGH SAMPLES (n_sift ≥
      target) or on TIME OUT (cap), whichever comes first. Underwater P_click falls
      ~2 decades across the range of interest, so a fixed qubit count would either
      waste hours on the near points or never finish the far ones.
  [2] CHECKPOINTING — every finished point writes a CSV row immediately. A re-run
      skips points already present. A power cut at 3am does not lose the whole session.
  [3] PER-CLICK LOGGING — irrad (SNR proxy) + bmatch + err for every click, so the
      sliding-window / vs-SNR QBER figures (like Fig. 3 of the previous paper) can be built.

Run:
    python python/fpga_collect.py --port COM10 --phase fixed
    python python/fpga_collect.py --port COM10 --phase adaptive   # after flipping SW[1]=1

⚠ --chunk is always 1. The bitstream currently on the board has NO command FIFO;
  sending back-to-back loses commands and drives P_click down ~0.4× (see tb_cmd_fifo.v).

        ⚠ WHICH BUDGET TO USE. Stopping on `target_sift` is a rule CORRELATED WITH
        THE FADING: a point that happens to open on a bright stretch reaches its
        sifted quota sooner and ends there, so the sample over-represents high-h
        blocks. The pooled P_click is biased up by roughly σ²_h / n_blocks, and the
        dispersion statistics are biased DOWN because the run stops right after a
        run of good blocks. Measured: the L5 point at 25 m finished in 129 blocks
        where L1 needed 154, and its P_click came out 1.21× the model.

        For anything whose measurand is a DISPERSION (section B), pass
        `target_qubit` instead: a fixed number of attempts is independent of the
        fading, so the block sample is unbiased. The adaptive sifted-bit budget
        stays right for the range sweeps, where P_click spans two decades and a
        fixed attempt count would either waste hours or collect nothing.

        `chunk` sends that many qubit commands back-to-back, then paces the loop at
        the FPGA's own speed (chunk × qubit_s) while harvesting click lines in bulk.
        Only valid on a bitstream with the command FIFO (top_module.v [v11],

        comes out ~0.4× the model. Keep chunk ≤ 64 and verify with --chunk-check
        before committing to a long run.

        A click line can arrive after its own chunk's window closed; it is simply
        harvested by a later pass. Only aggregate counts are used, so the shifted

#
# WHY THE TARGET FALLS WITH RANGE. QBER is a binomial estimate: its standard
# error is √(q(1−q)/n_sift), so the figure needs n_sift, not qubits. But
# sift_eff = ½·P_click drops ~2 decades over 5→35 m, so a flat target would put
# 90% of the session on the last point. These numbers spend the budget where it
# buys resolution and let the Clopper-Pearson bound speak for the far points.
#
# Model QBER (L1, 450 nm) and the σ each target buys:
#     5 m 1.64% ±0.40   10 m 2.18% ±0.46   15 m 2.68% ±0.57   20 m 3.17% ±0.72
#    25 m 3.69% ±0.94   30 m 4.40% ±1.68   35 m 5.84% ±2.5
# The steps between adjacent points (~0.5%) are comparable to σ out past 20 m —
# the TREND is resolved, adjacent points are not. Say so in the caption.
#
# The caps are a SAFETY NET at 2× the expected time, not a schedule — every point
# normally stops on target_sift well before its cap. They assume the ~3300-3900
# qubit/s that bulk harvesting plus FIFO-paced writes sustain; run --chunk-check
# to confirm the rate on your board, and pass --cap-scale if it comes out lower.
#
# sigma = √(q(1−q)/n_sift) at the model QBER, i.e. the resolution each target buys:

#   45 m 12.97% ±1.94   50 m 19.73% ±3.25
# The ~0.5%/point steps out to 30 m are now 2-3 sigma apart, so adjacent points
# separate rather than merely tracing a trend. The far points are deliberately

    dispersion measurement must not use a fading-correlated stopping rule.

    Far points never reach the target — that is deliberate: the Clopper-Pearson upper
    bound then says outright that the sample is small, instead of faking a QBER.

    `turb` applies to sections A and D (they must share a level to be comparable).
    B sweeps L1…L5 by definition; C stays at L3. Which level A and D run at barely
    matters for the MEAN: P_click is linear in h, so the expectation cancels the
    fading — verified, L1 and L5 give identical mean_metrics to every printed
    digit. Turbulence shows up in the per-click irrad distribution and in the
    between-window variance, which is what section B is for.

    # produces byte-identical tags to a --turb 1 run, so the checkpoint skips
    # every point and the session silently collects nothing. The level goes at
    # the END so tags still start with "A_dist", which is what paper_figs
    # matches on.

    # ---- B. QBER vs turbulence level, fixed range -----------------------
    # Expectation: the MEAN QBER stays nearly constant (P_click is linear in h,
    # so the expectation cancels the fading). Measuring that is itself a result —
    # it is what makes repeating the whole range sweep at L1…L5 unnecessary.
    #
    # WHERE the point sits matters, and it is NOT the near field. The turbulence
    # signature the hardware can actually resolve is the spread of the per-click
    # irrad field, i.e. CV(h) = √[(1+σ²_s)(1+σ²_ho) − 1]. Measured on the board,
    # CV bottoms out at ≈0.14 (12-bit h + 256-point inverse-CDF ROM), and at
    # d = 5 m the model puts L1 at 0.031 and L2 at 0.061 — both under that floor,
    # which is exactly why the collected d0 L1 and d0 L2 came out at 0.140 and
    # 0.141, indistinguishable. At dist_idx 4 (25 m clear ocean) the model gives
    # CV = 0.18 (L1) … 2.1 (L5), all above the floor and monotone in the level.
    #
    # [v12] With the coherence block counted in QUBITS (--coh 11 → 65 536), this
    # section no longer settles for the per-click irrad spread: each block is one
    # frozen fading sample, so the PER-BLOCK QBER becomes a real measurement and
    # its std / outage can be compared straight against
    #     UWOCChannel.window_statistics(window = 65536).
    #
    # Sizing is driven by the number of BLOCKS, and the budget is in ATTEMPTS, not
    # sifted bits. The first run of this section used a sifted-bit target and the
    # bias showed immediately: L1 needed 154 blocks to reach 6000 sifted while L5,
    # opening on bright fading, got there in 129 — so the strongest-turbulence point
    # had the SMALLEST and most favourably-selected sample, exactly backwards.
    #   dist_idx 4 (25 m), P_click ≈ 1.19e-3 → 78 clicks and 39 sifted per block,
    #   comfortably above channel_monitor's MIN_SIFT = 16.
    #   relative s.e. of a std estimate ≈ 1/√(2·N_blocks) → 160 blocks gives ±5.6%,
    #   against a model separation of std(L1) = 3.1% vs std(L3) = 4.1% vs
    #   std(L5) = 22.1%. 160 blocks ⇒ 1.05e7 attempts ⇒ ~47 min at 3700 qubit/s.

    In the adaptive phase λ is NOT the one the host asked for: the controller's
    hill-climber owns it, and while it probes a candidate the link runs on that
    candidate. In clear ocean 650 nm is 27× worse than 450 nm at 15 m and 92× at
    25 m, so a stuck probe drops P_click straight onto the Y₀ floor — the same
    symptom as a command FIFO overflow, which is why the 2026-08-09 session was
    spent chasing --chunk instead of the controller. The two are separable
    because dropped commands scale P_click by a factor INDEPENDENT of range,
    while a wrong λ scales it by exp(−Δc·d) and therefore lands exactly on the
    model of another wavelength.

    Two signatures, because a probe can be stuck for a whole point or only for
    part of it:
      STUCK — P_meas matches the model at some other λ (within 2×).
      FLAP  — P_meas sits between the best and the worst λ, i.e. the point is a
              time-average of a good λ and a dead probe. The mixing fraction is
              reported: on 2026-08-09 both 15 m and 20 m came out at 14%, the
